## The problem:
Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

## Examples
For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

## Solution
For this challenge there is both a solution in R (leap_year.R) and a solution in Python (leap_year.py)
